Linux software RAID is great, but when you have to replace, re-add, drop, repair, check drives all the time, it can become slow and tedious.  mdadm tools will examine your Linux RAID arrays, report on the health and allow you to prepare RAID sets for disk replacement as well as allow to to add and re-add disks that have dropped from the array(s).
